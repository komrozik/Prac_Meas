\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
The strong deviation of the single sensor in time can probably be explained by a different time zone of the computer time (probably Turkey) of the respective PC.
In addition, the gradual drop in temperature before inserting the sesnors into the water bath can be explained by the fact that the air in the container just above the water surface is probably colder than the air in the rest of the room.

Looking at the graphs of the temperature sensors, the readings are only slightly off, suggesting that the sensors are working properly.
The calculated time constant seems to be legitimate compared to the literature values of $200$\;ms in water and $95$\;s in water.
The value of \SI{11(2.82)}{\second} lies exactly between the two literature values, which is reasonable considering that it was a change of measurement in air and water.
