Practical Measurement Electronics and Interfaces in ocean Sciences

In this Repository, I saved all the codes for the Practical Measurement Electronics Course at the UNiversity of Hamburg.
The code consists of files in C++ for the Arduino and Python code to analyse the produced data.
The Arduino was connected to a temperature measuring device lowered in water to see the different temperature layers in an experiment tank.
